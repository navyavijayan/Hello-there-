## Dream big and keep learning!

Welcome to my webpage. You can find my personal portfolio on this website. 
Two words to describe me - **Dreamer** and **Learner**. 
Apart from work, I love singing and reading. Scroll down to find some interesting things I have done so far!

### Writing
My stint at writing started during the Covid-19 Lockdown. I find it extremely freeing and as a decluttering experience.
Feel free to check out my musings at [writings](https://github.com/navyavijayan/Navya-Vijayan/blob/main/Writings.md)
